        Auth[Authentication]
        Validator[Data Validation]
        Logger[Audit Logging]
        Privacy[Privacy Protection]
    end

    subgraph Compliance
        Standards[Web Standards]
        Accessibility[WCAG]
        Security[OWASP]
    end

    Auth --> Validator
    Validator --> Privacy
