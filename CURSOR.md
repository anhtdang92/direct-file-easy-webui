# AI Tax Filer - Development Notes

## Latest Updates
- Implemented basic tax filing form
- Added form validation
- Set up logging system
- Configured CORS and security middleware
- Added responsive design with Tailwind CSS

## Current Features
1. Frontend
   - React with TypeScript
   - Tailwind CSS styling
   - Form validation
   - API integration
   - Responsive design

2. Backend
   - Express server
   - Logging system
   - CORS configuration
   - Security middleware
   - Rate limiting

## Development Environment
- Node.js v24.1.0
- npm v8.19.2
- React 18.2.0
- TypeScript 5.2.2
- Tailwind CSS 3.4.17

## Known Issues
1. PostCSS warning about module type
   - Solution: Add "type": "module" to package.json
   - Impact: Minor performance overhead

2. Port conflicts
   - Solution: Kill existing processes or change ports
   - Impact: Development workflow

## Next Steps
1. Add user authentication
2. Implement tax calculation
3. Add PDF generation
4. Implement AI features
5. Add multi-step form
6. Set up testing
7. Deploy application

## Development Tips
1. Use `npm run dev` for frontend development
2. Use `node src/index.js` for backend development
3. Check logs in `backend/logs/tax-filer.log`
4. Use browser dev tools for debugging
5. Follow TypeScript best practices
